"""
Real-time (inference-time) QLoRA training over a loaded exllamav3 ``Model``.

The idea: one loaded EXL3 model serves generation AND trains its LoRA adapter,
alternating between the two. This works because the two forwards already share
everything: the differentiable training forward (:class:`NativeLlamaQLoRA`)
reconstructs the decoder on top of the *same* loaded modules the native
inference forward uses, and the native ``Linear`` modules carry runtime LoRA
slots that ``NativeLlamaQLoRA.apply_to_native()`` can fill in memory -- no
save/load round-trip, no second model copy. This module adds the coordination
layer that makes the alternation safe and useful:

  * :class:`RealtimeQLoRA` -- owns the trainable net, the AdamW optimizer and
    a global step counter, all kept alive between calls (the adapter trains
    across many small ingests like one long run).
  * ``ingest(samples)`` -- trains through an array of samples at the
    configured batch size / gradient accumulation until they are depleted,
    then pushes the updated adapter into the inference forward and fires the
    registered update callbacks (KV-cache invalidation), then returns to
    serving.
  * a readers/writer lock -- inference requests are readers
    (``with rt.inference(): ...``), an ingest is the writer. A waiting ingest
    blocks NEW inference readers (writer preference, so a busy server cannot
    starve training) but always lets in-flight ones drain first.
  * timestamped checkpoints -- every ``checkpoint_every`` optimizer steps the
    adapter (PEFT format, loadable by ``LoRA.from_directory`` / PEFT / the
    offline trainers) plus optimizer state is written to
    ``checkpoint_dir/ckpt-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS-stepN``, giving a rollback point if
    a bad batch damages the adapter. ``keep_checkpoints`` prunes old ones.
  * a constant, externally settable learning rate (``rt.lr = 5e-5`` between
    ingests, or ``ingest(..., lr=...)`` per call) -- an endless sample stream
    has no epochs, so there is no schedule to run.

KV-cache staleness: after an adapter update, every cached KV entry computed
THROUGH an adapted k_proj/v_proj is stale. Two supported answers:

  1. (default) nuke the cache on every update -- ``attach_generator(gen)``
     registers ``gen.pagetable.reset_page_table()`` as an update callback, so
     prefix reuse restarts from nothing and the next requests re-prefill.
  2. adapt only projections that never enter the cache --
     ``target_modules=["q_proj", "o_proj", "gate_proj", "up_proj",
     "down_proj"]`` -- and register no cache callback. Zero invalidation cost,
     slightly weaker adapter.

Serving integration (e.g. tabbyAPI's ``backends/exllamav3/model.py``): build a
``RealtimeQLoRA`` next to the loaded ``Model``/``Generator``, call
``attach_generator(generator)``, wrap each generator drive (the
``generator.iterate()`` loop or a blocking ``generator.generate``) in
``with rt.inference():``, and hook ``rt.ingest(samples)`` (run it in a worker
thread/executor -- it blocks until the samples are depleted) to whatever
endpoint or UI feeds training examples. Everything else -- what the model
serves, how requests are queued -- is untouched; the wrapper deliberately does
NOT re-implement any of ``Model``'s API.

Sample forms accepted by ``ingest`` (mixable in one call):

  * ``{"input_ids": [...], "labels": [...]}`` -- pre-tokenized (labels
    optional; ``-100`` masks positions; defaults to supervising everything).
  * ``{"text": "..."}`` -- plain text, fully supervised.
  * ``{"prompt": "...", "response": "..."}`` -- tokenized separately and
    concatenated so the mask boundary is exact; the prompt is masked, the
    response (plus ``config.eot_text``, if set) is supervised. The caller
    renders the chat template into these strings -- exactly what an inference
    server already does.
  * ``{"messages": [...]}`` -- OpenAI-style conversations, IF a
    ``render_segments`` callable was provided (sample -> ordered
    ``[(text, supervised)]`` segments; ``training/chat_jinja.py``'s
    template-driven builders produce this contract -- see
    ``training/realtime_chat.py`` for the wiring).

Preference samples (DPO / KTO) mix into the same ``ingest`` call. They use
TRL's *explicit prompt* format -- the prompt is its own field, never
repeated inside the completions -- and train the adapter with the same
objectives as the offline ``training/qlora_train_pref.py`` (the frozen base
is the reference model, obtained by running the same net with its adapters
disabled; no second model copy):

  * ``{"prompt": ..., "chosen": ..., "rejected": ...}`` -- one DPO pair.
    ``prompt`` is either a rendered prompt string (ending with the
    assistant-turn opener, as for ``prompt``/``response``) or a list of
    messages, which needs a ``render_prompt`` callable (sample -> masked
    ``[(text, supervised)]`` prompt segments rendered WITH the generation
    prompt; ``realtime_chat.py`` wires the chat template). ``chosen`` /
    ``rejected`` are completion strings or single-turn assistant message
    lists; ``config.eot_text`` is appended to each. Loss: ``config.dpo_loss``
    (sigmoid / hinge / ipo) at ``config.beta``, cDPO ``label_smoothing``.
  * ``{"prompt": ..., "completion": ..., "label": True/False}`` -- one
    UNPAIRED KTO row (``label`` truthy = desirable). Loss: ``config.kto_loss``
    (kto / apo_zero_unpaired) at ``config.beta`` with
    ``desirable_weight`` / ``undesirable_weight``. The ``kto`` variant's KL
    reference point is estimated per micro-batch from mismatched
    prompt/completion pairs, which needs ``batch_size >= 2`` (TRL's rule);
    a singleton KTO micro-batch trains with ``KL = 0``, which is exactly the
    ``apo_zero_unpaired`` loss.
  * pre-tokenized: ``{"prompt_ids", "chosen_ids", "rejected_ids"}`` and
    ``{"prompt_ids", "completion_ids", "label"}`` (no BOS/eot handling --
    the ids are used as given).

SFT rows, DPO pairs and KTO rows need different forwards, so consecutive
same-kind samples form the micro-batches and a kind change closes the
current accumulation window (order is still preserved). Preference windows
accumulate example-weighted (the step gradient equals one big batch mean,
TRL's reduction); a prompt+completion that does not fit ``seq_len`` gets its
completion tail truncated, and a row whose prompt alone fills ``seq_len`` is
skipped and counted in the returned stats. Note that a preference step costs
one extra no-grad reference forward (two more for KTO's KL rows) on top of
the policy forward, and that a DPO pair is two sequences per forward.

VRAM note: training shares the GPU with the serving cache. The transient
training footprint (activations under gradient checkpointing + fp32 Adam
moments for the LoRA only + per-layer trellis dequant scratch) rides on top of
the allocated ``Cache``; size ``seq_len`` x ``batch_size`` so both fit --
on a 16 GB card with a small model and a modest cache, seq_len 1-2k at batch 1
with grad accumulation is the sane starting point.

Idle offload (``offload_when_idle``, default on): between ingests the model
only SERVES, but the persistent training state -- fp32 LoRA masters, fp32 Adam
moments, PiSSA offset copies -- would otherwise sit idle in VRAM. So after
every ingest (and at construction) that state is moved to system memory and
the CUDA caching allocator is flushed; the next ingest moves it back before
training. Value-exact both ways (device moves, not casts), and generation is
unaffected while offloaded -- inference reads the fp16 runtime LoRA slots
pushed by ``sync_to_inference``, which stay on the GPU. The cost is one
HtoD/DtoH round-trip of the training state per ingest, noise next to the
training itself. Disable it (``offload_when_idle=False``) only if ingests are
so tiny and frequent that the copies ever show up in a profile.

Aux component parking (``offload_aux_when_training``, default on): a serving
stack for a multimodal / MTP-capable checkpoint typically loads extra
component models next to the text trunk -- a vision tower for image input,
an MTP head as speculative-decoding draft model. Training never touches them
(the LoRA targets live in the text trunk), so while an ingest runs they are
dead weight in VRAM. Register them with ``attach_aux_models(vision_model,
draft_model)`` and every ingest parks them out of VRAM for its duration --
unloaded going in (KV cache layers of a draft model included), reloaded
value-exact to the same devices on the way out (through the safetensors
collection; the OS page cache makes the reload a system-RAM read in
practice). Restoration is guaranteed even when the ingest itself fails. See
``aux_offload.py`` for the mechanism and its limits (no TP-loaded models).

CPU-testable: the ingest loop, lock, encoding and checkpoint policy take the
net/tokenizer through narrow interfaces, so ``tests/test_realtime.py``
exercises them with stubs -- no CUDA, no model.
